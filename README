Data structure

Defined a matrix class, that stores x and y dimensions, as well as a vector of
values. This will be defined for data of type float and int, for testing.

The class handles its own memory management, and supports indexing into the 
matrix as normal.



Algorithm
There are five different algorithms to implement based on the number of matrices and number of processors:

1) Sequential multiplication on the CPU
2) Sequential multiplication on the GPU
3) Optimized sequential multiplication on the GPU
4) Binary tree parallel multiplication on the GPU
5) Hybrid approach between 3 and 4.

The goal is to keep all cores busy, while running a work-efficient algorithm. 
We do not have enough cores to run an inefficient algorithm, even if the time
complexity is theoretically better for large numbers of cores.




Compilation:
run make

Usage:
./multiply 0.08 10000

This will initialize 5000 matrices with the value 0.2, and then multiply.
